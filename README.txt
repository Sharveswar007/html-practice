## 👋 Introduction

Hey there! I'm **Sharveswar** — a student and aspiring web developer, eager to learn and share my progress in HTML.  
This repository is a collection of simple, beginner-friendly HTML projects I built while learning the basics of web development.  
If you’re starting out or just want to see what you can do with pure HTML, you’re in the right place! 🌱
